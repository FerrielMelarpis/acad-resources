Problem 1:  Search (17 Points) 
Consider the following graph.  Note that each link is bidirectional and labeled with its cost, and each node 
contains a number in parenthesis that corresponds to a heuristic estimate of the cost remaining to reach the 
goal node. For the following questions you are to search from node A to node Z (start at node A and find 
a path to node Z), using the prescribed search algorithm.  Break any ties that arise by alphabetical order 
(extend the node that comes first alphabetically first).  For this problem, the words extended and expanded 
are interchangeable.  Make sure to search from A to Z. 
Part A (1/2 point) 
What node should you start your search from?  Yes, it?s that easy. 
Part B (1/2 point) 
What node should you search to? Yes, it?s that easy. 
2 
Part C (3 points) 
You are to perform breadth-first-search.  Do not use an enqueued list or an extended list.  Do not extend 
any partial path to a node that it already contains.  Use the convention that a path to the goal is only 
returned when the goal node is extended, not as soon as it appears in the queue. 
Write down all the nodes extended, in the order in which they are extended. 
Give the full path that is returned. 
For your convenience, the graph is redrawn: 
3 
Part D (3 points) 
Perform depth-first-search (with backup).  Do not use an enqueued list or an extended list.  Do not extend 
any partial path to a node that it already contains.  Use the convention that a path to the goal is only 
returned when the goal node is extended, not as soon as it appears in the queue. 
Write down all the nodes extended, in the order in which they are extended. 
Give the full path that is returned. 
For your convenience, the graph is redrawn: 
4 
Part E (3 points) 
Perform A* search using the estimates shown.  As always with A*, you are to use an extended list.  Do not 
extend any partial path to a node that it already contains.   
Write down all the nodes extended, in the order in which they are extended. 
Give the full path that is returned. 
For your convenience, the graph is redrawn: 
5 
Part F (2 points) 
Suppose you implemented depth-first-search, with backup, without an enqueued list or extended list but 
forget to disallow the extension of partial paths to nodes which they already contain. Would your 
depth-first-search implementation find a path from A to Z? 
Yes No 
Is it true that in general the specified search will always find a path from one node to another (in any 
graph), if such a path exists? 
Yes No 
Part G (2 points) 

Suppose you implemented breadth-first-search, but forget to disallow the expansion of partial paths to 

nodes which they already contain.  Would your breadth-first-search implementation find a path from A 
to Z? 
Yes No 
Is it true that in general the specified search will always find a path from one node to another (in any 
graph), if such a path exists? 
Yes No 
Part H (3 points) 
Did your A* search produce the optimal path?

Yes No 

Explain why or why not. Hint: check your answer against the diagram.

Problem 2: Constraint Satisfaction (15 points) 
Tired of being overshadowed by New York City, upstate New York has claimed independence from the 
city of New York, and changed its name to New Yorkshire.  As part of this campaign of reaffirmation of 
identity, New Yorkshire has asked to become part of New England.  The governors of New England have 
reacted by forming a council to determine the admission of New Yorkshire to their group. Consensus has 
been reached in the council on the basis of map coloring: 
(1) If maps of the Extended New England can still be colored Red Green and Blue, New YorkShire 
will be admitted.  
(2) In addition to that, Massachusetts legislature (seeking an opportunity to forever define the 
political color of its state) has required that any new coloring should have Massachusetts shown in Blue 
(3) Not willing to concede on its identity Vermont has further added the restriction that should New 
England be extended, any future map have Vermont shown in Green to honor their motto: ?The Green 
Mountain State?. 
Your task, as consultant to New England?s 
council in AI matters, is to determine if New 
England can be extended to include the 
brand new state of New Yorkshire. 
In this problem you will be asked to color  
the Extended New England. The graph of 
extended new England is displayed in the 
figure to the right. 
The edges in the graph are to be seen as not-
same constraints. 
1 Domains (1 point) 
Write Down the initial domain of all the variables according to the specifications of the council: 
VT NH ME 
CT RI 
MANY 
CT MA ME NH RI VT NY 
{R, G, B} { } { } { } { } { } { } 
In the following three questions you will be asked to solve the constraint satisfaction problem using: 
1) Backtracking with Forward Checking + propagate through domains of one 
2) Backtracking with Forward Checking 
3) Backtracking 
Note that we have ordered the searches we ask you to do so that the one that we think generates the 
largest tree is last.   For your convenience the graph is presented in every page.  .

Problem 3: Neural Networks (22 points) 
In this problem you are asked to build a neural network step by step, and then reason about the properties 
of this network. The problem has many questions but the amount of work required is much less than it may 
seem at first glance.  We first guide you in constructing a particular type of neural network. Then, we ask 
you to reason about the network you just built.

At first, we are interested in building a network using  
a perceptron type step function as the threshold unit 
rather than a sigmoid functions.  Formally, the step 
x

function threshold unit is defined as follows: 
?

S(input) =

?

The step function is shown in the figure to the

right. Note the convention adopted for 
the output when input=0, which will matter 
later on.  With  this definition, the output of the 
unit in the figure can be written as  0

Building the final unit (1 part, 1 point)

outputs of S1 and S2.: 
11.Complete the expression for output of the third 
threshold unit in terms of:

This data may look familiar, but as a wise Spanish proverb says: ?At night, all cats look brown,? 
which implies that you should wait until light shines on the problem before jumping to conclusions.

So are the weights constrained? (4 parts, 8 points) 
Consider the three data points

12.Looking at the formula you obtained in part 11, use the table above to determine three constraints 
on the weights for the final unit (w

)

Consider now the following variables and domains:

14.Run constraint propagation (a.k.a. arc consistency) on the above graph, and fill the table below as 
you proceed (if some arc does not exist in your graph, just cross it out) :

15.What are the possible solution(s) you get? 
A sigmoid neural network (5 parts, 10 points) 
Now asume that we want to use sigmoid units instead of step units. Recall that a sigmoid unit would look 
like: 
1 
0.8 
1 
s(input) = 
1 + e
?input 
0.6 
0.4 
0.2 
0 
S(input) 
-10 -5 0 5 10
z 
16. Show the new output of s
3
 in terms of x
1
 and x
2
. Note that s1 and s2 must not appear in your 
solution. Look back at question 11 and replace the step functions that appeared there by the 
sigmoid expression.  Set the ?s and the ?s to +1 or -1 in accordance with your answers to part 5 
and part 10. Simplify the result as much as you can. 
s
3
( ) 

17.Recall that the output of a sigmoid function is continuous. However, for classification, we use the 
following relation: 
?
0 if s(input) < 1/ 2
class =
? 
?
1 if s(input) ? 1/ 2 
15 
Draw approximately the decision boundary of the sigmoid network if  the weights in the final unit were: 
w
13
=2, w
23
=2, w
3
=2. and the ?s and ?s are +1 or -1, as determined in part 16. 
18. Do the same assuming the weights were w
13
=2, w
23
=2, w
3
=1 using the same ?s and ?s as before. 
19.Comment on the most salient difference, if any, between the decision boundaries produced by a 
sigmoid unit and a step threshold unit. 
20.What would you change, if anything, in the sigmoid function to arbitrarily approximate the 
decision boundary when using the step function?

Problem 4: Boosting (17 points) 

Consider the following dataset, in which points are numbered for easier identification later on and where 
plus and minuses show the class information.  For your convenience, the diagram is reproduced on a 
tear-off sheet at the end of this examination.

For this problem, we will consider the following set of decision stumps to be the hypothesis space of the 
weak learner. (A decision stump is a one-test decision tree.)

Remember that the signs at each side of these thresholds are to be determined based on the training data. 
For example, looking at the x2=4, with initial uniform weights, both sides of the boundary are going to be 
positive, and thus there will be 4 mistakes ( the 4 minuses). 
Tie break-up: 
a) If when determining the class at each side of the threshold you get a tie, you shall ignore the 
weights and decide based on regular count of each class. 
b) If when choosing between stumps, you get a tie, you shall choose by the number associated with 
each stump; lower number takes precedence. 
17 
Part A: 2D data, ? crunch the booster(2 parts, 13 points) 
1.	 (10 points) Boosting is all about iterating.  Fill in the two tables below with the result of 
carrying on three iterations of the boosting algorithm.  At each iteration, choose the classifier with 
the lowest ?.  Remember that 
?	 D(i) stands for the weight of sample point i. 
?	 ? is the error of the classifier chosen at that iteration 
?	 ? is the weight of the classifier in the final majority vote 
Note, filling in the first two iterations is worth 80% of the points of this question, filling the third column is 
worth the remaining 20%. 
Stump error t=1 t=2 t=3 
h1 
h2 
h3 
Note, even if it is possible to start boosting with an arbitrary set of weights on the data, for this problem 
you are expected to start with uniform weighting of the data. 
We have filled in one of the answers for you so as to demonstrate the form we require for your answers.

values. Assume we restart boosting with uniform weights on the samples

Problem 5: Concept Learning (14 points) 
You wish to teach Marvin the Robot the concept CUP using images A through G below.  Marvin, as it 
happens, uses Winston's concept learning system, along with a vision system that delivers for each image: 
1. a shape description of the base of the object: 
Any 
Flat 
Pointed
4-sided Triangle Circular 
2. whether the object has a handle or not (only A, F, and G have handles) 
3. whether the object is closed or open (only C and F are closed) 
4. the ratio of width to height ? a positive real number 
Image A B C D E F G 
Ratio 0.5 0.5 0.5 2 0.4 0.3 0.35 
Here are the 6 images you present to Marvin: (Hits are ?positive? examples, while misses are ?negative? 
examples).  Images A, B, C, D, F are circular, E is pointed, G is  4-sided. 
A - HIT B - HIT C - MISS 

D - HIT E - HIT F ? MISS G - MISS 

20 
PART A: (6 points) 
For each of the images presented to Marvin, write an English description of the model Marvin builds, and 
determine which heuristics, if any, Marvin uses to update his model: 
Image Heuristics Used Marvin's Model of CUP 
A None has handle, is open, circular bottom, ratio=.5 
B 
C 
D 
E 
F 
G 
Here are the list of heuristics Marvin could use: (see pg. 356 in Chapter 16, reproduced on tear-of sheet at 
the end of the examination) 
require-link, forbid-link, climb-tree, enlarge-set, drop-link, close-interval 
PART B: (4 points)

PART C (4 points) 
Suppose you trained Marvin the Robot on the concept POT, and Marvin arrived at the following model: 
Marvin's Model: 
POT: must be open, must have handle, and  1.4 < width/height < 1.6 
You have a choice to present Marvin with one of the 5 images: 
A B D X Y 
has handle, no handle, no handle,  has handle, has handle, 
open, open, open open, open, 
flat bottom, flat bottom, flat bottom, flat bottom, flat bottom, 
width/height=.5 width/height=.4 width/height=2.0 width/height=1.5 width/height=3.0 
MISS MISS MISS HIT HIT
