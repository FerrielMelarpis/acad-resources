Question 2: Trees and Neighbors (30 points) 
As you probably know, Ben Bitdiddle and Louis Reasoner each have little brothers who are freshman in 
MIT?s class of 2008. Ben and Louis have decided to use some machine learning techniques to determine 
what major would best suite their respective younger siblings.   
Part A (10 points) 
Ben and Louis collect 16 data points, shown on the graph below (make sure not to miss the two points on 
the Y axis). The Y axis represents a student?s score on the MIT math assessment test (normalized to range 
from 0 to 10), while the X axis represents how nice a student?s clothes are (again normalized to range from 
0 to 10). The ?B? represents Ben?s little brother, while the ?L? represents Louis?s little brother.   
Carefully and precisely draw the decision boundary on the graph above by applying the principle of 
nearest neighbors (ignore the ?B? and ?L? points for now). 
3 
Part B (2 points) 
How is Ben?s little brother classified using 1 nearest neighbor? 
How is Louis?s little brother classified using 1 nearest neighbor? 
Part C (2 points) 
?That can?t be right? muttered one Course 6 hero to the other.  ?Must be noisy data?Let?s use three 
nearest neighbors instead.? 
How is Ben?s little brother classified using 3 nearest neighbors? 
How is Louis?s little brother classified using 3 nearest neighbors? 
Part D (1 point) 
Finally, how would each little brother be classified if Ben and Louis were to use 16 nearest neighbors?

1.
Part E (7 points) 
?I?m still not convinced this is working.  Why don?t we give ID trees a shot??  Ben and Louis decide to 
make their first test be: 
Clothes < 5.5 
The boundary created by this test is shown on the graph below.   
Give the average disorder produced by the test (again ignoring the ?B? and ?L? points).  Your answer 
may contain logarithms but no variables.  
5 
Part F (8 points) 
Further subdivision is needed no matter what the result of the first test.  In particular, the samples that fall 
into the ?Yes? category of the first test (those on the left of the vertical line in the graph) still need to be 
divided further. What test would you use to divide them into groups of minimal average disorder 
and what would be the resulting average disorder?

Question 3: Neural nets (40 points) 
The following sigmoid network has 4 units labeled 1, 2, 3, 4.  All units are sigmoid units, meaning that 
their output s(z) is computed using the sum of their weighted inputs: 
s(z) = 1

That is, output = 1 for input greater than 0; output = 0 for input equal to or less than zero.

Indicate which of the networks you expect to give nearly zero error on the given data set by circling one or 
more of the following: 
A B C D E

Part D (4 Points) 
Indicate whether the following statement is true or false by writing ?true? or ?false? in the box, and 
explain why in a few words.  Our solution will have 10 words or less. 
For a fixed network architecture, the backpropagation algorithm is guaranteed to find the best possible set 
of weights, given sufficient training data. 
Part E (3 Points) 
Indicate whether the following statement is true or false by writing ?true? or ?false? in the box, and 
explain why in a few words.  Our solution will have 10 words or less. 
You can always improve performance on both your training and test sets by adding more hidden layers to 
your network.

Problem 4:  Support Vector Machines (15 Points) 

The following diagrams illustrate the behavior of support vector machines that have been trained to 
separate pluses (+) from minuses (-).  The origin is at the lower left corner in all diagrams.   
Exactly the same kernel function was used to produce both left and right pictures in each pair, and that 
kernel has one of two forms:   
||x
1
?x
2
||
2 
e 
?
? or 
(x
1 
? x

)
n 
In some diagrams, red vectors are marked because the machine was unable to handle all the samples; it 
gave up on noting that one or more weights seemed to be climbing toward infinity. 
For each pair, circle the kernel that was used to generate both diagrams of each pair.
