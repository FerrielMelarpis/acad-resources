Much of the material in 6.034 is reinforced by online artificial-intelligence demonstrations developed by us or otherwise available on the Web. Those developed by us are provided via the easy-to-use Java??? Web Start mechanism, which comes with the Java??? Runtime Environment, the so-called JRE.
The demonstrations illustrate the following ideas:
Blocks world manipulation (After Winograd)
Search: depth-first, breadth-first, hill-climbing, beam, branch and bound, A*
Games: mini-max, alpha-beta
Genetic Algorithms: crossover, mutation, fitness
Constraint Satisfaction: drawing analysis (after Waltz, using Huffman labels)
Domain Reduction: map coloring, resource allocation
Learning: nearest neighbors, self-organizing maps, support vector machines, boosting
The JavaTM Runtime Environment needs to be installed on your computer before running the demonstrations. To install this application, visit the following Web site.
Preliminary instructions for using the demonstrations (PDF)
Run the demonstrations. (JNLP)
