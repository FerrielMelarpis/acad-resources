Quiz 1 
Problem 1: Search (75 points) 
This problem has a certain resemblance to a problem on Quiz 1, but it is not the same. 
Several 6.034 students are stranded in a strange city at the node marked S.  Desperate for a meal, 
they want to get to Hose?s food truck located on the map at the node marked T.  All the streets 
are one-way streets.  Each link between node pairs is 1 unit long.

Part A (10 points) 
Amy calculates how many paths terminating at nodes T or D she would produce if she 
used the British Museum Algorithm.  As expected with the British Museum Algorithm, 
she does not use an extended list.  Her result is: 
Part B (10 points) 
 
David decides to use plain branch and bound, without an extended list and with no 
estimate of remaining distance, to compute the shortest path between S and T.  If there is 
ever a choice in which path to extend, he picks the path closest to the top of the page.  
Before he can be sure he has the shortest path, he produces n  paths starting at S and 
ending at a node marked T or D and adds those paths to the queue.  In this case, n is 
 
 
 
Part C (15 points) 
 
James thinks it would be better to use  an estimate of remaining distance with the basic 
branch and bound procedure.  Also, he does use an extended list.  His estimate for each 
node is the straight-line distance to T.   
 
Is James?s heuristic admissible? 
 
 
If there is ever a choice in which path to extend, he picks the path closest to the top of the 
page.  Before he can be sure he has the shortest path, he produces  n  paths starting at S 
and ending at a node marked T or D and adds those paths to the queue.  In this case, n is

Part D (10 points) 
 
Natalya thinks James is on to something, but in her analysis, Natalya uses branch and 
bound together with a different estimate of remaining distance:

Is Natalya heuristic admissible? 
 
 
Natalya uses an extended list.  If there is ever a choice in which path to extend, she 
picks the path closest to the top of the page.   Before she can be sure she has the shortest 
path, she produces n paths starting at S and ending at a node marked T or D and adds 
those paths to the queue.  In this case, n is 
Part E (20 points) 
Olga thinks Natalya is on to something and uses the same method, except that Olga?s 
estimate of remaining distance is Natalya?s + 1:

Part F (10 Points) 
Raluca thinks it would be a good idea to use branch and bound with an extended list, 
and she also decides not to bother with an estimate of remaining distance.  However, she 
starts at T and looks for S, moving only backwards along the one way streets. 
 
If there is ever a choice in which path to extend, she picks the path closest to the top of 
the page.   Before she can be sure she has the shortest path, she produces n paths starting 
at T and ending at a node marked S and adds those paths to the queue.  In this case, n is

Quiz 1 
Problem 2: Rules (25 points) 
Susan  is developing a chemical synthesis system.  Her system has powerful rules that figure out 
what simpler chemicals are needed to synthesize a given chemical, and the even simpler 
chemicals needed to synthesize the simpler pieces, and so on for many levels. 
 
She estimates costs for chemicals by making a lot of telephone calls.  Generally, the simpler the 
chemical, the cheaper it is.  It is worth noting that the calls take a lot of time and that Susan can 
never remember the cost of a chemical she checked out previously. 
 
In any case, because she wants to use the cheapest chemicals possible, she decides to have her 
system to do a lot of rule chaining before she calculates the cost of the chemicals at the bottom of 
the tree produced by the chaining.  
 
 
Part A (10 Points) 
 
Suppose that for any given chemical, Susan?s system knows how to synthesize it out of b simpler 
chemicals and that she decides to let her system backward chain through d levels of rules.  How 
many costs of chemicals will she have to determine to estimate the cost of the synthesis? 
 
 
 
Part B (15 Points) 
Unfortunately, Susan?s hyper critical boss, says he cannot always wait for an answer---he wants 
a just-in-time system that provides a cost estimate whenever he asks for one, and perhaps a 
cheaper solution if he asks later. 
 
Holly suggests that Susan exploit the progressive deepening idea commonly used in playing 
games.  This means Susan?s system will have to compute costs at every level of the tree, not just 
the bottom level.  Susan worries that much time will be wasted.  Holly assures her that the time 
wasted in ensuring a just-in-time answer down to level d-1 will only be a fraction of the time 
needed to do the estimates at level d.  The fraction is approximately

Quiz 2 
Problem 1: Search in Games (50 points) 
In the game of Tic-Tac-Toe, your goal is to get three O?s in a row, either horizontally, vertically, 
or diagonally.  Players alternate placing X?s and O?s on the board.  If the opponent places three 
X?s in a row, you lose.   
 
You decide to use minimax-with progressive deepening to determine which moves you should 
make.  You use the following heuristic to perform static evaluation: 
 
heuristic(state) =    -5  if there are three X?s in a row 
                      5 if there are three O?s in a row 
                      the maximum number of O?s in a diagonal, row, or column with no X?s. 
          0 otherwise 
 
Suppose the game board looks like this: 
 
 
 
Part A (10 points) 
The six possible places that you can place an O are indicated in the diagram, labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
and 6.   
 
 
 
 
Where would you place an O given the static values associated with each choice and no further 
search?  (In case of a tie, enter the lower/lowest number) 
 7
Part B (20 points) 
 
Because you do not know how deep you will be able to search, you decide to use the progressive 
deepening idea.  Accordingly, you decide to reorder the branches before searching to the next 
level.  Which ordering do you use to evaluate the children of nodes 1-6?    (In case of a tie, enter 
the lower/lowest number)

If you place the next O in cell c, which spot on the tic-tac-toe board does the opponent 
place the next X, given the static values produced by the heuristic.  (In case of a tie, enter 
the lower/lowest number) 
 
If c = 1, the opponent places the next X in cell:     
If c = 2, the opponent places the next X in cell:      
If c = 3, the opponent places the next X in cell:      
If c = 4, the opponent places the next X in cell:      
If c = 5, the opponent places the next X in cell:      
If c = 6, the opponent places the next X in cell:

Part C (10 points) 
 
Now, consider the possible board positions after you have placed a O and your opponent has 
placed an X.  After  applying the minimax procedure to the static values of those board positions, 
which square do you choose to place the first O?  (In case of a tie, enter the lower/lowest 
number)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Part D (10 points) 
You desire to use progressive deepening to the next level, depth 3.  Accordingly, you decide to 
reorder the six branches of the minimax tree that descend from the board position given in Part 
A.  Which ordering do you use?  (In case of a tie, enter the lower/lowest number)

Problem 2: Constraint Propagation (50 points) 
Joseph has encountered a network capacity diagram and he is trying to solve for maximum flow 
in the network.   
 
He creates the following constraint network with the integer domains shown: 
 
 
f

Note that there are two constraints among three variables.  These are indicated by the curvy lines 
that come together.   
 
In this constraint network, the variables are the integer values of flow through each node.    The 
constraints between variables are indicated by the curved and straight lines between variables.  
The domains are the possible values of flow through each node.  These are represented by the 
integer values in each node. 
 
Joseph has a device which measures flow.  He obtains an estimate of flow that passes through 
each node, but is unsure.  The possible values are indicated by the domain of each variable.

Part A1 (10 points) 
In preparation for placing the first decision boundary, what disorder does Angelique compute for 
the decision boundary x = x1.  You may write your answer in terms of a variable-free expression 
involving only integers, arithmetic operations, and logarithms. 
 
 
 
Part A2 (10 points) 
Assume that the best decision boundary at any given point in building a classification tree is the 
boundary that puts the most samples in a homogeneous set.  On the diagram on the previous 
page, draw the first 3 decision boundaries Angelique produces using the identification-tree 
algorithm.  In case two decision boundaries are equally good, use a horizontal rather than a 
vertical.  If there is still a tie, use the smaller threshold.   
Part A3 (10 points) 
The worst possible average disorder producible by a decision boundary is the same as the 
disorder of the complete data set handled by the decision boundary.  Write the equation of the 
worst possible decision boundary for this problem. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Write the disorder produced by the worst possible choice of a first decision boundary.  In this 
part, we want an exact numerical answer, with no logarithms.

Part B (20 points) 
Peak says he thinks the data come from planets of three types in a distant star system.  He 
suggests that it would be interesting to try a transform to ease the problem of placing decision 
boundaries. 
 
Part B1  (6 points)  What is Peak?s transform? 
 
Part B2   (7 points) 
 
Label the axes and roughly sketch the data on the following coordinate system.  The way you 
organize the points must show you have the right idea, but you need not place each point 
accurately. 
 
 
Part B3 (7 points) 
 
Show the decision boundaries Peak  produces by the identification-tree algorithm from these 
samples.

Problem 2: Neural Nets (50 points) 
In the neural network shown in the figure, the outputs of neurons A, C and D are computed by 
the sigmoid function.  The output of neuron B is computed by a linear function, that is, by 
multiplying the weighted sum of B?s inputs by a constant, c.  The standard performance function, 
P = -? (d-z)
