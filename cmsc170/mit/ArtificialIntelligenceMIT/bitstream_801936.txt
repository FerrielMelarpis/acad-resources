Question 1: Rule-based reasoning (35 points) 
Mike Carthy decides to use his 6.034 knowledge to take over MIT. To this end, he wants 
to identi@ individuals as being communists. He would like to identify less powerful 
people first, to build a reputation for himself. 
He produces the following rule set: 
(PO 

(IF 

THEN (evaluate-gradstudents))) 

(PI 

(IF (evaluate-gradstudents) 

(?person is gradstudent) 

(?person researches ?topic) 

(?topic nationally-valuable) 

THEN (?person communist))) 

( p2 
(IF (evaluate-gradstudents) 

DELETE (evaluate-gradstudents) 

ADD (evaluate-professors))) 

(P3 

(IF (?xis professor) 

(?y is student of ?x) 

(?y communist) 

THEN (?xcommunist))) 

Mike debugs his rule set on the following fabricated data: 
~l:(Tanis researches finance) 

A2: (Jennifer researches ColdFusion) 

A3: (Cat researches ethics) 

A4: (finance nationally-valuable) 

A5: (ColdFusion nationally-valuable) 

A6: (Tanis is gradstudent) 

A7: (Jennifer is gradstudent) 

AB: (Cat is gradstudent) 

A9; (Winston is professor) 

A10: (Tanis is student of Winston) 

~11:(Cat is student of Winston) 

Part A: Backward chaining (15 points) 
Part A.l (10 points) 
You are to simulate backward chaining with the hypothesis (Winston Communist). To 
do this, you are to fill in the following table with the patterns that the system tries to 
match against the database, in the order that the system tries to match them against the 
database. To get started, we have put (Winston Communist) in the table. 
- --- 
-.
 You have enough or more than enough room in the table. 
Essential Assumptions: 
1. 	 Whenever the system's user is asked if an assertion is true, (that is, when the assertion 
is not found in the assertion database and the assertion does not match any consequent 
in a rule), the user answers no. 
2. 	 The backward chainer does not add any assertions to the database, so it can derive the 
same result multiple times. 
3, Conflict resolution is by rule order. 
4. 	 If a variable in a rule can be bound to multiple bindings (for example, binding ?topic 
to finances or ethics), order the bindings according to the order in which the 
corresponding value appears first in the assertion base. 
It may be useful to draw an and-or tree, and we have provided room on a tear-off sheet at 
the end of the quiz, but we will only grade work shown in the table.

Part B: Forward Chaining (10 points)

Mike decides to see if he can improve his rule set using genetic algorithms. He devises an 
asexual reproduction plan, in which mutations delete rules, and crossovers reorder them. 
The fitness of a rule sets is determined as follows: 
1. A rule set that doesn't halt in 100 steps of forward chaining get a 0. 
2. Otherwise, +1 for every communist identified. 
What will Mike need to evolve a rule set which is more fit than the current rule set (gets a 
higher value from the scoring polynomial, when run on the current assertions)? Circle 
your answer and explain. 
a) mutations 
b) crossovers 
c) either 
d) both 
e) neither can make a better rule set on these assertions.

Question 2: Search (35 points) 

A slider puzzle contains several small, square pieces that fit together into a rectangle with 
a hole in it. For example: 
A move consists of sliding a piece into the empty square. Thus, two moves are possible 
from the example: 
You can solve a slider puzzle by doing a search on it, where every step of the search is 
sliding one piece to a new place. 
If a search uses a heuristic estimate of the distance to the goal, take that heuristic distance 
metric to be the number of pieces that are in a place that should be blank or occupied by a 
piece of the other type. For example, if the goal is: 
then the heuristic value associated with the following configuration is 2 because a 0 is 
where a 1 should be and the 1 is where a blank should be. 
The actual distance between two states is the number of moves taken to get from the first 
state to the second. 
Break ties according to the position of the blank space when you scan left to right in the 
top row, then the bottom row as in the following examples: 
comes before which comes before 
If two different states remain tied, break that tie using the 1 piece. 
Part A: Breadth first search (7 points) 
WI

Perform a breadth-first search fiorn to 
You are to draw the 
search tree, and each node in the tree is to be identified by 3 x 2 drawing of the puzzle 
state. Assume that you are using a queue-based algorithm that terminates as soon as a 
path fiom the start to the goal reaches the front of the queue. Include in your tree all 
nodes at the ends of paths that you put on the search queue. Do not use an extended list 
in your search. 
Part B: Depth first search (7 points) 
If you were doing a depth-first search, would you need to allow backtracking to ensure 
that you find a solution for the initial state and goal shown in part A? Circle your answer: 
Yes @ 
Part C: Hill climbing (7 points) 
Perform a hill-climbing search from to . As in Part A, draw the 
tree. Include in your tree all nodes at the ends of paths that you put on the search queue. 
Do not use an extended list in your search. Do not use backtracking. Use the heuristic 
distance metric provided in the introduction to this problem. 
Part D: Admissibility (7 points) 
Suppose you define a heuristic to be admissible if and only if the heuristic is a lower 
bound on the number of moves from a given state to the goal state. Given this definition, 
is the heuristic we have supplied admissible? Circle your answer and explain:

the introduction to this problem. 
Question 3: Games (30 points) 

Consider the following game tree: 
The value near a node is the value that would be returned by the static evaluation 
function if applied to that node. 
Part A: Minimax (12 points)

Part B: Alpha beta and progressive deepening (18 
points) 
Suppose you do not know the best. choice of the maximizer at A or its minimax value yet. 
You are considering using one of the following two methods to compute the best move 
for the maximizer at A. 
Method A: Alpha-Beta without progressive deeping on the whole tree (i.e., down to 
depth 5) with a left-to-right order of evaluation for the children of each node. 
Method B: A form of progressive deepening with Alpha-Beta. Instead of performing 
Alpha-Beta down to every depth, you only do it twice: first to depth 2, and then to depth 
5. 
When running Alpha-Beta down to depth 2, you use a left-to-right order of evaluation for 
the children of each node and depth 2 static values that have been added to the game tree, 
as shown on the next page. 
Then, when running Alpha-Beta clown to depth 5, you reorder the nodes at depth 1 and 
depth 2 using the values of the nodes determined while running Alpha-Beta down to 
depth 2. You reorder so as to try to increase the effectiveness of the full Alpha-Beta 
search. 
Once you reorder the nodes at depth 1 and depth 2, you no longer use the static values at 
D, F, and G; instead you use only the static values provided at the leaf nodes. For nodes 
at depth 3 and greater, use the notie order as shown in the figure.

Part B2 (6 points) 
Using the method you chose for your previous answer, your method will traverse the tree, 
extending some nodes and performing static evaluation at others. List the nodes that are 
extended or statically evaluated in the order that your method does the extension and 
static evaluation, starting with A. 
Note: list a node more than once if it is extended more than once while performing the 
search. For instance, if you chose Progressive deepening with Alpha-Beta, node A must 
appear twice in the list.
