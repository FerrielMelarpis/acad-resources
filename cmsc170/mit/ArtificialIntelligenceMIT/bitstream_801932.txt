Problem 1. Constraint Propagation (34 pts)

The following constraint network represents a coloring problem with 6 variables (Var 1 though 6) and one 
or two or three colors in the domain of each variable (B, G, R, and Y).  Each line represents a constraint 
that requires that the two variables have different colors.

Binary constraints between variables are due to touching regions, while the domain restrictions on each 
variable come from some other source. 
Part A: (6 pts) 
Draw a map containing 6 ?countries? that exhibits the same constraints as the above constraint graph: 
6

5

Two of the 6 countries are drawn for you. Draw 4 additional countries above such that if there is a 

constraint between two blocks, the two blocks share a boundary.

Part B (28 points)

Find one of the valid solutions for this problem using backtracking with forward checking AND 

propagating through singleton domains . Examine variables in numerical order and values in 

alphabetical order.  

(1) Variables are explored in numerical order, starting with Variable 1. 
(2) Values (Colors) are explored in alphabetic order (B first, then G, then R, then Y) 
2 
Draw a search tree for using backtracking with forward checking AND propagating through singleton 
domains . 
In addition: 
1.	 For every node in the tree draw only the valid descendants at that point and 
2.	 For every node in the tree draw the domains at that point, assuming constraint propagation runs 
through all singleton domains  until no further domain reduction is possible anywhere and 
3.	 Mark with an ASTERISK (*) ALL nodes at which assignments initiate constraint propagation 
through singleton domains.

Part B1: (4 pts) 
How many asterisks did you mark in your tree? 
Part B2: (8 pts) 
Interpret your tree by filling in the blanks below: 
The first time in the tree search that a variable assignment produces propagation through singleton 
domains is when variable ________ is assigned the value ________.   
After propagation, the domain of variable(s) _______ is /are found to be empty, and backtracking 
occurs. 
Part B3: (8 pts) 
Circle either (I), (II) or (III), and fill in the corresponding blanks, if appropriate : 
(I) 
The second time that a variable assignment produces propagation through singleton domeains is 
when variable ____ is assigned the value ____.    
After propagation, the domain of variable(s) ____ is /are found to be empty, and backtracking 
occurs. 
(II) 
The second time constraints are propagated through singleton domains is when variable ____ is 
assigned the value ____. 
After propagation, the search continues with another variable assignment. 
(III)

Constraints are not propagated through singleton domains a second time.

Part B4: (8 pts) 
After the search is finished, the resulting variable assignments are: 
Var 1 Var 2 Var 3 Var 4 Var 5 Var 6

Question 2: Nearest Neighbors and ID Trees 
(30 points) 
Here is a set of data on Foos and Quxes.  You want to classify a and b as a Foo or a Qux.  (Note: if you 
need a straightedge, the side of a sheet of paper works well.)

Part A: ID Trees (14 points) 
First, use the ID Tree idea. We have provided you with the first test: ?Is the mass less than or equal to 6?? 
and drawn it below: 
Part A1 (4 points) 
What is the disorder of the first test?  Write your answer in terms of fractions and logs. You need not 
compute a numerical answer with a calculator. 
6 
Part A2 (6 points) 
Test2, which is to test just one variable, will occur if the answer to test1 is true. Draw test2 below: 
Test3, which is to test just one variable, will occur if the answer to test1 is false. Draw test3 below: 
7 
Part A4 (4 points)

Using the ID tree you have completed, how would you classify a and b? 
a is a b is a 
Part B1 Nearest Neighbors (6 points) 
Now you classify a and b using nearest neighbors. Draw the decision boundaries for nearest neighbor 
decisions, assuming 1 nearest neighbor is all that matters, on the graph below. 
Part B2 (4 points) 
Using 1 nearest neighbor, a is a and b is a 
Part C (6 points) 
Using 3 nearest neighbors, a is a and b is a

All units have step function thresholds, not sigmoids!! 
That is, output = 1 for input greater than 0; output = 0 for input equal to or less than 0. The black box in 
the diagram is a transmogrifier that converts its input into the following outputs:
