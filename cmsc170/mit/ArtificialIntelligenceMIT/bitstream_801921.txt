Question 1: Semantic Transition Trees (12 points) 
Use the grammar shown below (in the syntax used for PS3) to answer all parts of this 
question. Lines of the grammar file are numbered for reference. 
1: (?sentence ?noun-phrase ?verb-phrase 
    %end `(action = ,?verb-phrase thing = ,?noun-phrase)) 
2: (?noun-phrase ?determiner ?noun %end ?noun) 
3: (?verb-phrase ?verb ?direction ?place %end ?verb) 
4: (?place ?determiner ?noun %end ?noun) 
5: (?direction (onto %end '()) 
       (into %end '()) 

(around %end '())) 

6: (?verb (hopped %end 'jump) 
(ran %end 'traverse) 

(leaped %end 'jump) 

(walked %end 'traverse)) 

7: (?noun (rabbit %end 'rabbit) 
(table %end 'table) 
          (bunny %end 'bunny)  
(chair %end 'chair)) 
8: (?determiner (the %end '()) 
(a %end '()) 
(an %end '())) 
Part 1.1: Parsing (6 points) 
1.1.1: (3 points) 
What will be returned from a parse of the sentence, "The rabbit hopped onto the table"? 
(If the parse fails, enter "NULL") 
1.1.2: (3 points) 
What will be returned from a parse of the sentence, "The rabbit leaped over to the chair"? 
(If the parse fails, enter "NULL")

Part 1.2: Augmenting the Grammar (6 points) 
Suppose we want to augment the grammar so the system can handle sentences with zero 
or one adjective. The goal is to change the grammar so a parse of sentences such as, "The 
cute bunny walked onto the table" will not fail but that all sentences that previously 
parsed correctly will still continue to do so. To accomplish this, We start by creating the 
adjective tree shown below. This line is added to the end of our grammar file. 
9: (?adjective (cute %end '()) (red %end '()) (fuzzy %end '())) 
1.2.1: (3 points) 
One other line must be changed so our parser will make use of this adjective tree and 
achieve the goal described above. Changing what line will accomplish this task? Note 
that there is more than one correct answer. 
1.2.2: (3 points) 
Enter your changed line here:

Part 2.1: Decision boundaries, warm up (9 points) 
2.1.1: Nearest neighbors (3 points) 
Draw the decision boundaries produced by a 1-nearest neighbor classifier on the 
following samples of circles and triangles. 
4

2.1.2: Standard identification tree (3 points) 
Repeat, but this time, draw the decision boundaries found by an identification tree 
builder. Assume that all tests are of the form x < T or y < T, where T is a threshold value. 
5

2.1.3: Augmented identification tree (3 points) 
Again, find the decision boundaries found by an identification tree builder, but this time 
suppose that your test options include not only x < T and y < T but also x - y < T and x + 
y < T, where T is a threshold value. 
Part 2.2: Decision boundaries, movies (28 points) 
Excited about the performance of classifiers you used for learning viewer preferences and 
recommending movies, you decide to apply your expertise to a new domain. This time, 
you want to recommend music to people, based on what they have rated highly before. 
However before you make any recommendations, you need to recognize each listener's 
category, based on each listener's music tastes, determined by the listener's ratings for 
two songs. 
Below, you are given a chart that shows how various people, belonging to 3 different 
listener groups, rated two songs. To make a recommendation to a new person, you first 
want to identify to which listener group they belong, and then to make a recommendation 
based on what others in the listener group rated high. 
The circles, triangles and diamonds represent three groups of people with a consistent 
music taste.

2.2.1: Nearest neighbors (8 points) 
On the chart, draw the decision boundaries produced by a 1-nearest neighbor classifier on 
the samples. Later on, we will refer to this as option A. 
Extra copies of this chart are on the tear-off sheet at the end of the quiz. 
2.2.2: Standard identification tree (4 points) 
Repeat, but this time, draw the decision boundaries found by an identification tree 
builder. Assume that all tests are of the form x < T or y < T, where T is a threshold value. 
Later on, we will refer to this as option B. 
7

2.2.3: Disorder Calculation (4 points) 
What is the entropy (disorder) associated with the first test in the decision tree found by 
an identification tree builder? You may write your answer as a number or a variable- free 
expression. 
2.2.4: Augmented identification tree (4 points) 
Again, find the decision boundaries found by an identification tree builder, but this time 
suppose that your test options include only x - y < T and x + y < T, where T is a threshold 
value. Later on, we will refer to this as option C. 
8

2.2.5: Disorder Calculation (4 points) 
What is the entropy (disorder) associated with the first test in the decision tree found by 
an identification tree builder described in 2.2.4? You may write your answer as a number 
or a variable-free expression. 
2.2.6: Picking a theory (2 points) 
Which of the three options do you consider best? 
Which of the three options do you consider worst?

2.2.7: Identification (2 points) 
In the following chart, what is the label of the unknown person *U, using the 1-Nearest 
Neighbor method and the Euclidean distance as the distance metric? 
What is the label using the 3-Nearest Neighbor method and the Euclidean distance? 
What data point is most likely to be noise? Circle it on the graph.

Question 3: Neural Nets (31 points) 

Special note: You can get the correct answer to the second, easier part of this problem 
even if you do not find the correct answer to the first part. 
Show your work so that we can try to find opportunities for partial credit. 
Consider the following network (several copies are on a tear-off sheet at the end, for your 
convenience: 
There are four neurons, a, b, c, and d, all of which use a sigmoid function. 
You can use the following values to approximate the sigmoid function. The table is also 
on the tear-off sheet. 
Input -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
Output 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.04 0.12 0.27 0.50 0.73 0.88 0.96 0.98 0.99 1.00

Part 3.1: Forward Propagation (21 points) 
You are given all but three of the weights, along with this data, which provides the 
observed output, given three sets of input values: 
X 
-2 
0 
0 
Y 
0 
1

Z 
0

0.1 
Q 
0.96 
0.96 
0.73 
Note: all of the numbers should come out nicely if you round to the nearest tenth. 
Calculate the values of the three unknown weights: 
3.1.1: Alpha (12 points) 
3.1.2: Beta (6 points) 
3.1.3: Gamma (3 points) 
12

Part 3.2: Backward Propagation (10 points) 
Consider a situation when the inputs are X=2, Y=7, Z=2 and the output is Q=0.5. If the 
desired value Q* is 0, and the rate constant is 4, then how much does gamma change 
after backpropagation? Note that we are not asking for the new gamma, but only the 
change.

Question 4: Miscellaneous (20 points) 
Circle the best answer for each multiple choice question. No penalty for wrong answers. 
Perceptron units are less useful than sigmoid units because: 
? Perceptron units are much more computationally expensive 
? Multilayer perceptrons are too hard to train 
? Perceptrons cannot be used to differentiate more than two types of object 
? All of the above 
? None of the above 
Neural networks ... 
? Use faithful models of neurons in the human brain. 
? Always eventually converge to the correct answer. 
? Work best with very little training data. 
? All of the above 
? None of the above 
Given an arbitrary binary expression (e.g. (X AND Y) OR (NOT Z)) the minimum 
neural network that can be used to compute it is: 
? A network with 1 layer of neurons. 
? A network with 2 layers of neurons. 
? A network with 3 layers of neurons. 
? A network with 4 layers of neurons. 
? A network with an arbitrary number of layers. 
? It may not be computable. 
You have to develop a classification system given a n-dimensional sample set for which 
it is known that some of the dimensions are completely irrelevant. Unfortunately, you do 
not know which of the dimensions are irrelevant. You immediately conclude that the best 
approach of the following approaches is: 
? A nearest-neighbor classifier. 
? A neural-net classifier. 
? An identification-tree classifier. 
The topological sorting algorithm ensures that: 
? Precedence order is depth-first, up-to-join
