Problem 1: Search in Games (50 points) 
 
Part A: Minimax (6 points) 
 
 
 
 
Compute the minimax value of 
 
A =  
 
 
B =  
 
 
 
 
 
C =

Part B: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning  
(20 points) 
 
In the game tree below, clearly indicate with a checkmark the nodes/states that are 
statically evaluated during minimax with alpha-beta pruning.

Part C: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning and 
Progressive Deepening (10 points) 
 
When answering the question in Parts C.1 and C.2 below, assume you have already applied 
minimax with alpha-beta pruning and progressive deepening on the corresponding game 
tree up to depth 2. The value shown next to each node of the tree at depth 2 is the 
respective node?s static-evaluation value. Assume the procedure uses the information it has 
acquired up to a given depth to try to improve the order of evaluations later. In particular, 
the procedure reorders the nodes based on the evaluations found up to depth 2 in an attempt 
to improve the effectiveness of alpha-beta pruning when running up to depth 3. 
 
We want to know in which order the nodes/states A, B, C, and D in the game tree are 
evaluated when the procedure runs up to depth 3, after running up to depth 2 and 
reordering. 
 
Part C.1: Game Tree I (5 points) 
 
Choose the order in which the nodes/states A, B, C and D in game tree  I above are 
evaluated when running minimax with alpha-beta pruning and progressive deepening after 
running up to depth 2 and reordering. (Circle your answer) 
 
a. A B C D 
b. D A B C 
c. B A D C 
d. C D A B 
e. D C B A

Part C.2: Game Tree II (5 points) 
 
 
 
 
Choose the order in which the nodes/states A, B, C and D in game tree  II above are 
evaluated when running minimax with alpha-beta pruning and progressive deepening after 
running up to depth 2 and reordering (Circle your answer) 
 
f. A B C D 
g. D A B C 
h. B A D C 
i. C D A B 
j. D C B A

Part D: Optimal Minimax with Alpha-Beta 
Pruning (14 points) 
 
 
In the game tree below, cross out the nodes/states that are not statically evaluated in the 
best case for minimax with alpha-beta pruning (when the procedure performs the smallest 
number of static evaluations ever possible for the given game tree).

Problem 2: Constraints (50 points) 
 
In the following questions, you will be asked to color in a map of some states and regions 
of the United States according to how you think they will vote in this years? election.  You 
created the following constraint network, which contains: 
? Nodes (which are the variables representing states that you will color) 
? Edges (which represent the constraints between variables) 
? Domains (the possible colors for each state or region, also listed in each node) 
 
You also know that Massachusetts will vote Blue, and that Texas will vote Red.  For this 
reason, you have restricted the value of those domains to just B and R, respectively.  If 
you?ve determined the vote of a particular state, no surrounding state may be the opposite 
color.  Whenever possible, you want to color surrounding states the same color, but if that 
is not possible, you decide to color them yellow, which acts as a buffer between the blue 
and red states. However, yellow states cannot share a border. 
 
The constraint used is NOT THE SAME AS IN THE MAP COLORING PROBLEM.  
Instead, the edge between states (or regions) indicates: 
? R-B, B-R, and Y-Y pairs are not allowed  
? R-R, B-B, R-Y, B-Y are allowed by the constraint

Part A:  Backtracking Search with 
Forward Checking (20 points) 
 
Draw a search tree using backtracking with forward checking (no propagation beyond 
neighbors of just-assigned variable).  For every node in your tree, draw only all its valid 
descendants. 
 
The constraint you should use is repeated below: 
The edge between states (or regions) indicates: 
? R-B, B-R, and Y-Y pairs are not allowed  
? R-R, B-B, R-Y, B-Y are allowed by the constraint 
 
For each node that was just assigned, order the descendents of the node in the order R, B, Y.  
 
A portion of the tree is drawn for you.

Part B: Backtracking Search with Forward 
Checking and Constraint Propagation (20 points) 
 
Draw the search tree that results from using backtracking with forward checking AND 
propagating through domains that are reduced to size 1 [singleton domains]. For every 
node in your tree, draw only all its valid descendants.  
 
The constraint you should use is repeated below: 
The edge between states (or regions) indicates: 
? R-B, B-R, and Y-Y pairs are not allowed  
? R-R, B-B, R-Y, B-Y are allowed by the constraint 
For each node that was just assigned, order the descendents of the node in the order R, B, Y.

Part C: Ordering Variable Assignments (10 points) 
 
Bill really wants to color states with his favorite color, and he has asked your help in order 
to do so.  Instead of assigning colors randomly, you decide to assign colors to states/regions 
using the same algorithm that you would use to speed up map coloring.  Using this 
algorithm for regular map coloring, after assigning values to Massachusetts and Texas, 
which state(s) would you color next? 
(If you think more than one state should be colored next, circle more than one answer.)
